# LD 44

My entry for the Ludum Dare 44.

# Concept

You are running a shop selling creative items with your spouse, but your business is not running as good as you expected, and you may soon have to close the doors.

A mysterious salesman arrives and proposes you to sell your relationship, memories and activities with your surroundings in exchange for tremendous funds for your company.
